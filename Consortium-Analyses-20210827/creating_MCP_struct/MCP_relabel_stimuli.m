function new_mcp_file = MCP_relabel_stimuli(mcp_file,old_label_name,new_labels,save_flag)
%MCP_RELABEL_STIMULI change names of stimuli in an MCP struct
% The function is called with the following arguments:
% MCP_relabel_stimuli(mcp_file,old_label_name,new_labels,save_flag)
%
% This is useful after the default naming, where integer marks get turned
% into names (e.g., 3 -> 'm3'). The function can be applied to rename
% multiple conditions at once (e.g., 'm2' and 'm3' -> 'cats')
%
% mcp_file: may be either a Matlab file (*.mcp extension) or an MCP struct
% in the current workspace.
% 
% old_label_name: may be either numeric trigger number or a char-type
% containing the previous name (e.g., 'm3' or 'cats')
%
% new_labels: may be either a char-type containing the new name (e.g.,
% 'felines') or a cell array of replacement names (e.g.,
% {'tabby','calico','tiger','garfield'}). However the cell array must have
% the same length as the number of instances of the old_label_name found in
% the mcp_file, or it will throw an error.
%
% save_flag: logical, set whether to write out a new *.mcp file. The file
% with have the same name as the mcp_file input, but with _r suffix.
